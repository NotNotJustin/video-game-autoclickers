# Minecraft Autoscroll


A simple solution to randomized building.


Minecraft is a game where creativity is key, as is survival. For the creativity side of things, some people like a randomized look from a specific block palette. Whether it be a floor, ceiling, or roof, this autoscroll program has you covered!


### How do I use this?


It's actually very simple! Press CTRL + Alt + Q to start the autoscroll script. Press F9 to Stop. Press F8 to Exit the app. When the script is running, use your Place button (typically Right Click) and the script should randomize the blocks you place.
